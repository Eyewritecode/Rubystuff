The file cia-1996.xml is the data from the CIA World Factbook of 1996 in XML format. It has details about 260 countries across five continents. Your challenge, should you choose to accept it, is to uncover the following details buried within this file:

- What is the population of the country with the most people? Yes, we know itâ€™s China, but just how many people lived there in 1996?
- What are the five countries with the highest inflation rates, and what were those rates in 1996?
- What are the six continents in the file and which countries belong to which continent? Can you also produce them in alphabetical order?
